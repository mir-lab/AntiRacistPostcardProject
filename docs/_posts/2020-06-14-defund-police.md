[Mapping Police Violence](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/) has a lot of good data -- a caveat is that this is the same people as Campaign Zero and 8 Can’t Wait -- 8CW is a bad campaign because they poorly interpreted the data, but I think the actual data is still very helpful and informative

[Million Dollar Blocks](https://c4sr.columbia.edu/projects/million-dollar-blocks) & [Million Dollar Hoods](https://milliondollarhoods.pre.ss.ucla.edu/) do a good job of showing how much money we waste on the carceral system instead of investing in communities
