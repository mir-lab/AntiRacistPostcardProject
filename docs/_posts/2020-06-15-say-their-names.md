## Summary

## Media
### Code Switch
[Code Switch](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510312/codeswitch) (this podcast is not specific to police violence but is a really good race and culture podcast that helps humanize a lot of these issues instead of talking about people like statistics)

### The Death and Live of Marsh P. Jonhson

## Groups
### Mapping Violence
[Mapping Police Violence](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/) has a lot of good data -- a caveat is that this is the same people as Campaign Zero and 8 Canâ€™t Wait -- 8CW is a bad campaign because they poorly interpreted the data, but I think the actual data is still very helpful and informative
