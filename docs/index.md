<!-- # Hello & welcome  -->
&nbsp;

## Welcome to our anti-racism intervention art project.    

### This is an anti-racism intervention art project to encourage folks to be 💥 _anti-racist._ 💥

### Our postcards playfully tackle issues of racism, implicit bias, anti-blackness, and white supremacy. Each of the postcards here tackle real issues and violence facing the world today — in sending them to our friends, family, and loved ones, we are encouraging them to also be actively anti-racist. 

### 🖤 We are your local anti-racist's and we stand with Black Lives Matter and all folks working toward a just society.
