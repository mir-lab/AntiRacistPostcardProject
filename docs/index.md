# Welcome to the Anti-Racist Postcard Project!    

## This is an anti-racism intervention art project to encourage folks to be 💥 _anti-racist._ 💥

### Our postcards playfully tackle issues of racism, implicit bias, anti-blackness, and white supremacy. Each of our postcards tackle real social issues and forms of violence facing the world today (they're just veiled as adorable cute messages). In sending them to our friends, family, and loved ones, we are encouraging them to learn more what's going on and how they can also their biases.

### 🖤 We are your local anti-racists and we stand with Black Lives Matter and all folks working towards a just society.
